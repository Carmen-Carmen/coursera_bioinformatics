project title: MTB-induced hypoxia transcription factor finding

36 strands in total in upstream250.txt

The motif found by MEME did not appear in all strands in upstream250.txt, regardless of finding in both given strand and reverse complement strand (default) or finding in only given strand.

Find in both given strand (+) and reverse complement strand (-): 
57(Rv1738+) 139(Rv1737c-) 107(Rv1733c+) 172(Rv2032-) 114(Rv2031c+) 136(Rv3134c-) 159(Rv1997-) 143(Rv3131+) 155(Rv3130c-) 186(Rv2006+) 178(Rv2005c-) 200(Rv2627c+) 118(Rv2623-) 137(Rv0574c-) 173(Rv1996-) 201(Rv0571c+) 160(Rv0079-) 62(Rv2626c-) 216(Rv2628+) 165(Rv2007c-) 45(Rv2631-) 204(Rv1734c+)

Find in only given strand (+): 
141(Rv1737c+) 169(Rv2031c+) 174(Rv2032+) 159(Rv3134c+) 139(Rv0574c+) 162(Rv0079+) 202(Rv1734c+) 161(Rv1997+) 198(Rv2627c+) 120(Rv2623+) 117(Rv1738+) 187(Rv1733c+) 180(Rv2005c+) 175(Rv1996+) 157(Rv3130c+) 214(Rv2628+) 199(Rv0571c+) 156(Rv0569+) 161(Rv2626c+) 184(Rv2006+)


If I let MEME to find the motif in both given strands and reverse complement strands, the length of the motif found was 20. 
The motif (consensus AAGGGCCGAAAGTCCCCAAT) found was very similar to that found by exact width 20 (AGGGCCGAAAGTCCCCAATT), the only difference was that the motif found this time seemed to start one nuceotide earlier than that found by exact width 20.

However, if I restrict MEME to find the motif only in the given strands, the length of the motif found was 38, which was different from 20. 
The motif (consensus string AGGGCCCTAAGTCCCCCGGCGCTAGGGACCTTCGGCCCT) seemed to contain part of that found by exact width 20 (consensus TAGGGACCTACGGCCCTAG).


I think it is better to start with long motifs.
Because if we start with short motifs, there is a bigger chance to find motifs with very high scores (scored by entropy), but these short motifs found might be contained in longer motifs, and longer motifs cannot be found because the highest scores are already achieved by these short motifs.
In contrast, if we start with long motifs, we might get low scores with these long motifs, but we will get higher and higher scores as the motif length decreases, and we will not miss any long motifs as the score should increment during this process. 


These string should be generated randomly, each nucleotide should have equal chance to appear in each position in these strings.

The python code to implement the idea above:

DNA_BASES = ["A", "T", "C", "G"]

def get_random_strand(length):
    result = ""
    for i in range(0, length):
        temp = int(random.random() * 4)
        result += DNA_BASES[temp]
    
    return result


If I restricted MEME to find the motifs only in the given strands, the motif logos from upstream100, upstream500 and upstream1000 were all similar to that from upstream250, among those the logo from upstream100 was the most similar with even no offset.

However, if I let MEME to find the motifs in both given strands and reverse complement strands, none of the motif logos generated from upstream25, upstream100, upstream500 or upstream1000 was similar to that from upstream250. 
While the motif logos generated from upstream500 and upstream1000 seemed to be similar with an offset of 2 nucleotides.

So, I uploaded the logos generated by MEME only in the given strands, which met the question better.


If I let MEME to find the motifs in both given strands and reverse complement strands, the motif logos generated from upstream100, upstream500 and upstream1000 were similar to that generated from upstream250. 
However the motif logo generated from upstream25 was totally different from that generated upstream250, it might attribute to the 25-nucleotide length of DNA strings was too short for finding 20-nucleotide motifs.

Moreover, if I restricted MEME to find the motifs only in the given strands, the motif logos generated from upstream100, upstream500 and upstream1000 were also similar to that from upstream250, among those the logo from upstream100 was the most similar with even no offset.
However, the motif logo generated from upstream25 was also different from that generated from upstream250, and the reason might be the same as mentioned before.

I only uploaded the motif logos found in both given and reverse complement strands, but the motifs found in only given strands were also very interesting.
